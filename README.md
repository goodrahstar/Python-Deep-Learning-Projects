## Getting Started
This book is aimed at intermediate machine learning engineers, software engineers, technology architects and programmers who are interested in knowing more about deep learning, especially applied deep learning, TensorFlow, Google Cloud and Keras. Python Deep Learning Projects is focused at the core of the data science pipeline – model building, training, evaluation, and validation. 

We approach deep learning projects from a very practical point of view. In thinking about how to share what we know, our experiences, the strategies that we've learned, and the tactics we employed in our daily day to day life. 

Tools and frameworks like, `Keras`, `TensorFlow`, and `Google Cloud` are used to showcase the strengths of various approaches covering `NLP`, `CV` and `ASR`.


### Prerequisites
This course is for intermediate machine learners like if you've undertaken at least one course in machine learning and have a modest functional proficiency in Python (meaning you can create programs in Python when supported by examples). Many of our readers will be undergraduates at university studying computer science, statistics, mathematics, physics, biology, chemistry, marketing, and business.

You will be successful in this course if you have a basic knowledge of computer programming especially Python programming language. Also some familiarity with deep learning like neural networks will be helpful. 

In this course, you will need a Google Cloud free tier account. Note that you won't be charged by creating the account. Instead, you can get `$300` credit to spend on Google Cloud Platform for 12 months and access to the Always Free tier to try participating products at no charge. By going through this course, you will probably need to spend at most `$50` out of your `$300` free credit.
